This research finds that various combinations of memories that speak to victimhood, resilience, loyalty, and never again are used via deletion, addition, repetition, and judgment to produce a dominant meaning of that particular history. Methodologically, this research employs the novel Story Completion method to navigate the fieldwork limitations imposed in the wake of COVID-19. ',

      "It didn't  take long for me to see how Shou is the consummate professional. His skill set is  wide-ranging and multi-faceted, but that barely scratches the surface of what makes Shou such an amazing asset to our team. Shou is pro-active, kind, and beyond hard working. To be honest, I don't know where he finds the hours to be so exact and detailed on such a wide range of projects, all while pursuing multiple volunteer opportunities that make his community a better place.</br> </br> <b> If you're looking for a combination of work ethic, attention to detail, reliability and heart, look no further than Shou. </b>",

      'I was Shou’s immediate intern supervisor during his internship at the Smithsonian Center for Folklife and Cultural Heritage. His main tasks were linked to the ongoing development of the Center’s Impact Evaluation Framework and management of ongoing project evaluations of our international cultural sustainability programs. Shou especially assisted with research on cultural industries, the creative economy and cultural tourism, writing and review of program reports and studies. He thought through any given task thoroughly and asked thoughtful questions if anything was unclear. He worked on developing and reviewing surveys, analyzing data, and provided very insightful feedback and recommendations, highly useful for the Center. He is an excellent researcher and he worked and networked successfully with many people at the Center from senior staff to fellow interns. Shou delivered great results on his assigned tasks and accomplished more than anticipated for the internship. </br></br> <b>I strongly vouch for his professionalism, research skills, responsible and mature nature.</b>',

      'Working with Shou was a wonderful experience. In addition to his highly personal potentials, he is always going beyond expectations. I worked with Shou in the same team, a multi-disciplinary group of international master students, on a consultancy project for an NGO over two months in Malta. During our time together, he was highly motivated and was all the time voluntarily took up additional tasks. </br></br> <b>Seeing creative solutions and using out of box thinking were the attributes that contributed uniquely to the team output.</b>',

      'Shou has shown incredibly multifaceted approach to thinking, and hard work ethics. During our stay at Okayama University which is a national university within Japan, Shou has shown in-depth understanding and hard work ethics for learning the Japanese language and culture. I worked with Shou on a few group projects together, and can vouch that Shou showed not only discipline in a group setting, but showed great leadership style and communication skills with other group members.Shou has the ability to adapt to any situation when needed and can think of new ideas that add to the discussion from a different perspective. The out of the box thinking can be seen with his passion for the arts. Shou also demonstrated a great cultural understanding and an eagerness to always learn. </br></br><b>This appreciation of a global identity has helped shaped Shou into a very internationally rounded individual.</b>',

      'I worked together with Shou on a research project about improving multi-modal transport on Malta, together with 27 other students from Wageningen University. During this project, Shou shared his creative ideas on video production and used his editing skills to make the video a high-end product. Moreover, Shou is very experienced with SPSS analyses and also showed his ability to work in different teams. </br></br><b>Shou is a hard-working, eloquent and passionate student and I enjoyed working with him.</b>',
