          'This research constructed a framework of mnemonic (re)production at the juxtaposition of critical discourse analysis and memory to extend the understanding of how meanings of past time are (re)produced through memories. This research finds that various combinations of memories that speak to victimhood, resilience, loyalty, and never again are used via deletion, addition, repetition, and judgment to produce a dominant meaning of that particular history. Methodologically, this research employs the novel Story Completion method to navigate the fieldwork limitations imposed in the wake of COVID-19. ',
