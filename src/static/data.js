This research finds that various combinations of memories that speak to victimhood, resilience, loyalty, and never again are used via deletion, addition, repetition, and judgment to produce a dominant meaning of that particular history. Methodologically, this research employs the novel Story Completion method to navigate the fieldwork limitations imposed in the wake of COVID-19. ',
