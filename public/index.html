      content="I am a Frontend Developer based in Los Angeles. Growing up in the United States as a 1.5-generation immigrant, I've had a fascination with how places, things, and websites communicate meanings and feelings without words ever since I learned to learn the English language through environmental contexts. Although I began as a consumer of these curated spaces, I've fallen in love with the process of growing ideas into spaces of experiences.

In the museum setting, that meant digging with a metaphorical shovel into numbers, stories, and artifacts to find the 'truth' of different people/times and weaving their experiences together into an easily digestible narrative that will inspire love and kindness.

Now, in frontend development, that means breathing personality into a web application, using surprise delightful interactions to enhance a visitor's day, and turning a website into spaces that evoke feelings reflective of a brand. "
